# Server

Epic test servers require epic technologies. We don't have epic technologies...
We created this repository to report issues and request features on the server.


### Issues
If they cannot be reproduced, they will be closed. Please provide as much details as possible,
this will allow us to fix it faster.

### Feature requests
Just explain clearly, provide screenshot if you want us to change something on the map.

### Help us translate the server
todo...(If your language is not available, please open an issue)
